# TO-DO-LIST
The To-Do List is a simple website that helps users keep track of their daily tasks. Users can add new tasks, mark them as completed, delete them, or clear the entire list. It is made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The tasks are saved in the browser, so they donâ€™t disappear when the page is refreshed.
